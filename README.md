# Exploring-Weather-Trends
We will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

# Installation
you should have Excel and some basic knowledge in SQL to query data

#  Project Description
We will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

#Instructions

Extract the data from the database. There's a workspace in the next section that is connected to a database. You’ll need to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where you live. You can find a list of cities and countries in the city_list table. To interact with the database, you'll need to write a SQL query.

Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.

Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.

Open up the CSV in whatever tool you feel most comfortable using. We suggest using Excel or Google sheets, but you are welcome to use another tool, such as Python or R.

Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable (the last concept in the previous lesson goes over how to do this in a spreadsheet).

Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.

# My observations that is:
1- my city temperatures are hotter than global temperatures almost three times.

2- the temperatures increase with the time increase for both my city and global temperatures in the last years.

3- the world become hotter through the years.

4-I notice in the global temperatures increase and decrease clearly unlike my city it seems there is a little of decrease and big increase.
